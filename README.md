## Description
 This project was built to aid in creating a professional README.md file . It is built with the idea that it will take less time to create a README file since sometimes that file itself can be a struggle for developers. Sometimes after a long day of coding you dont want to worry too much about the README.md file. Or the user sometimes forgets what goes into a README file so this application is built to be a guideline and to generate a good README.md by just answering a few questions in the terminal.
